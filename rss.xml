            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>From Science Fiction to Reality: The Evolution of Artificial Intelligence</h1><p>What was once just a figment of the imagination of some our most famous science fiction writers, artificial intelligence (AI) is taking root in our everyday lives. We're still a few years away from having robots at our beck and call, but AI has already had a profound impact in more subtle ways.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/f54cd0789e871eb11dfd0ee5cd8f20c64f2ca128.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>The Grid Website Platform Automatically Adapts Design To Make Your Content Shine</h1><p>Video Do websites dream of electric designers? Can web content know itself? The Grid, a San Francisco startup, is changing the way websites are designed by radically changing the role of the designer. This new platform uses machine learning combined with constraint-based design and flow-based programming to make form dynamically adapt to content.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/7e94b9a94d3e7cde42cd47e8323035d871ae04c0.jpg"></article>]]></description>

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>GSS: Layout Reimagined</h1><p>Layout on the web is certainly an extremely time consuming process and the most outdated. Floats and such still don't cut it.

            <description><![CDATA[<article><h1>Save the Galapagos With GMO Rats. What Could Go Wrong?</h1><p>The Galapagos Islands are famous for exotic birds, tortoises, and iguanas, but recently the archipelago had become overrun with more prosaic animals: rats and mice. Rodents that came on old sailing ships. Rodents that stowed away on modern cruises. Wherever they came from, rodents that eat the eggs and chicks and hatchlings of the animals that so dazzled Charles Darwin.</p><img src="https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/the-grid-img/p/6afa5ce0efaf82b5055dbbf26be5527fc65e81ef.jpg"></article>]]></description>
