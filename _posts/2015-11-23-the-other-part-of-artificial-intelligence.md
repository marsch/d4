# The other part of Artificial Intelligence

> Google is to Machine Learning, as the Grid is to Constraint Programming

"Machine" + "Learning" ... Oh, the beauty, the contrast, the tension of mechanical hardness possessed with the infinite fluidness of mind.  ("Constraint" || "Logic") + ("Programming" || "Satisfaction" || "Solvers") ... No contrast, no inspiration inducing tension.

> Constraint Programming represents one of the closest approaches computer science has yet made to the Holy Grail of programming: the user states the problem, the computer solves it. 

**E. Freuder, **Ph.D. MIT

As the first of the people of [the Grid][0], a purveyor of artificially intelligent designers-in-the-machine, I am often asked by what we mean by "AI".  I'll stumble across tweets from the smart & no-ill-will-intended doubting the plausibility of "real" AI. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/c3fe76a4-bb24-4c7f-81a7-650ab6944030.png)

The chasm between [the AI I learned at University][1] & Hollywood's AI is like that between technology & magic. To the initiate, desensitized by years of servitude to the master behind the curtain, the "magic" is just maniacal perfection of the trade. AI to me was what [textbooks like this][2] so effectively described; a field in Computer Science that applies constraint satisfaction & machine learning to solve problems that previously required humans to solve. A traditional AI course begins with it's history, explains how constraint solvers can be used to solve seemingly impossible logic problems & proceeds to show how various machine learning algos are effective at solving technical problems rife with ambiguity, like if their's a face in a picture, or if something is attractive or not.
