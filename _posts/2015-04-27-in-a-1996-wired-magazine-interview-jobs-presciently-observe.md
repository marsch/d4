  In a 1996 Wired magazine interview, Jobs presciently observed that the promise
  of the web was that "[a]n individual can put up a website that, if they put
  enough work into it, looks just as impressive as the largest company in the
  world... It's a very profound thing, and a very good thing."  Tocchini claims
  "We're getting the cruft of websites out of the way, this will help level the
  playing field in the spirit of Steve's quote, and keep focus on the real, hard
  work - creating quality content."
