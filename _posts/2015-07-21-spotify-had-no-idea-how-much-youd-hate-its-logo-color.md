description: "Spotify quietly changed the tone of its green last month and it drove people insane, wondering if they were imagining it or if something was wrong with their phones. The company's lead designer, Tobias van Schneider, wrote in his personal email newsletter today what happened when the company changed the color and how it didn't realize what had gone wrong at first."
