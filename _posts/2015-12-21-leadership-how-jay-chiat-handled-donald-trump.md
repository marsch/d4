description: "I worked at Chiat/Day for 20 years when Jay Chiat was changing the rules of the ad business. And building, from scratch, one of the greatest creative agencies ever. Many remember Jay's natural ability to recognize talent and push people well beyond their limits. But most don't know how he generated such extraordinary loyalty and dedication."
