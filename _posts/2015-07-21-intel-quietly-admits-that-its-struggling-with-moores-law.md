      No company sounds more religious about Moore's Law than Intel Corp., whose
      co-founder made a famous observation about the miniaturization of chip
      circuitry 50 years ago. But that doesn't mean the company opposes revising
      its canon.

      If it seems like only months ago that we were talking about Intel's fifth
      generation of processors for laptops, desktops, hybrids and tablets --
      also known by the codename Broadwell -- that's because it was.

      Intel says its next-gen "Cannonlake" chips will be delayed by six months,
      marking the second time in a row it hasn't released a CPU on a two-year
      "Moore's law" cycle. Last year's 14-nanometer Broadwell chips were
      similarly delayed, and even Haswell and Ivy Bridge were behind schedule.

      Clara, Calif.-based company has been struggling to make up for a slow PC
      market through its booming data center and Internet of Things business.

  Is Moore's Law finally faltering? Intel has confirmed today that its next
  generation of processors called "Kaby Lake" will be built using its existing
  14-nanometer process. It was expected the company would shrink its processor
  size down to 10-nanometers next year after the release of the next-generation
  'Skylake' chipset.
