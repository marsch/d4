      It seems like companies decide they're ready to redesign their website
      every 2 years or so. But it's a lot of work! You have to gather a team,
      find an agency, identify stakeholders, write personas ... You get the
      point. Nevertheless, every 2 years or so, we labor and labor to redesign
      and launch a website.

      Every year, Web design grows and so many awesome things are being
      published daily. I can only imagine that the best is yet to come in 2015,
      including many of the trends we predicted for 2014. While many of those
      trends will still be around in 2015 (and probably 2016), it's time to see
      what new trends are likely to emerge in 2015.

  Making the process of building websites less complicated is a growth industry.
  Just look at the success of WordPress and Squarespace. Yet with all the
  templates and customization available from these platforms, it still leaves
  humans to do most of the decision-making-should you put that checkout button
  in the middle or top right?
