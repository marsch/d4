  The Galapagos Islands are famous for exotic birds, tortoises, and iguanas, but
  recently the archipelago had become overrun with more prosaic animals: rats
  and mice. Rodents that came on old sailing ships. Rodents that stowed away on
  modern cruises. Wherever they came from, rodents that eat the eggs and chicks
  and hatchlings of the animals that so dazzled Charles Darwin.
