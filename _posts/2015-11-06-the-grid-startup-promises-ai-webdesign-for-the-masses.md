description: "The Gutenberg Press revolutionized printing in the 15th century, but it wasn't until the 1980s that the dot matrix printer brought the ability to print into every home. Today, the much celebrated power of the Internet to demolish barriers to publishing for the average person still requires the use of cumbersome intermediaries or \"walled gardens\" like Facebook."
