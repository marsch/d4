    title: 8 Examples Of How Google Is Moving Into Digital Health
    thumbnail_height: 433
    description: >-
      In July 2014, Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin sat down for a
      rare interview with Vinod Khosla where they discussed, among other things,
      Google's involvement in health. When Khosla asked if Google would ever
      become a healthcare company, both founders were somewhat critical of the
      current healthcare system's regulatory hurdles and because of this didn't
      envisage becoming a big player in the space.

  I'm in Hawaii right now, but I'm not here with family nor am I on a company
